What brings you here to today?

Me? Uh, I'm...
Who am I?

No memories huh?
It was worth a shot at least.
Don't worry, it's more common than you think.
Actually, it's usually the case.

Where am I?

I get that question a lot, and I'm still never sure myself.
The afterlife?
Purgatory?
Something in between?

I'm.. dead?

Depends on your definition of dead.
Some would argue if you were truly dead we wouldn't be having this conversation.
So some part of you is alive.

Are you..

	God?
	
		Me?
		Hahaha, hardly.
		I'm not even sure one exists to be honest.
		At least one in the traditional sense of the word.
	
	an angel?
	
		Maybe?
		My job is kind of like one I guess.
		
	
	the devil?
	
		Guilty conscience speaking?
		Don't worry, I'm nothing of the sort.
	
In a way I'm kind of like you.
The only difference being that I know why I'm here.
To guide people for what comes next.

...Comes next?

You're here because there's something holding you back.
Deep down there's a part of you that ties you down to the world you came from.
It's preventing you from moving on past this place.
And you'll be here until you figure it out!

In this [color] void?

Huh, it's [color] to you? Interesting.
No don't worry, you'll take form soon enough. We just first have to go over a few questions!
Do you see yourself as...

	masculine?
	feminine?
	something in between?
	
And a name. Do you have a name in mind for yourself?

	[Name entry]
	
I see, well it's very nice to meet you [name]. Can you try opening your eyes for me?
